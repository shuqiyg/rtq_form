	<h3 class="legalHeader"> Purpose of this Form </h3>
	<p>This application can provide an actual quote that can be bound by the Broker’s Representative. Certain conditions must be met: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> The broker must be approved by AM Fredericks Underwriting Management Ltd (AMFUM). This means that:
			<ul>
				<li>The broker has completed a Broker Application and been approved</li>
				<li>The broker has received an AMFUM Broker Number</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>This is for Named Perils Property and Liability (CGL) Rented Dwelling Coverage.</li>
		<li>The system may determine that some feature(s) of the risk require Underwriter intervention in order to produce a quote. In that case:
			<ul>
				<li>No price will be provided. Therefore,</li>
				<li>No binding option will be available (Submit only)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<h3 class="legalHeader">Limitations on Binding (if applicable)</h3>
	<p>Although Binding is initiated by the Broker through this form, it is not considered Bound until the representative receives a confirmation email directly from AMFUM. This confirmation will contain:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A copy of the information submitted in the form of an application.</li>
		<li>Notification that we consider this bound.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please note that completion of the on-line application does not eliminate the requirement for a signed application. Once the application is received, it is to be signed by your client and sent to us within five (5) days after coverage is bound.</p>
	<p>As is the case with quotes based on the traditional printed applications, our electronic quotation is made with reliance on the information contained in the electronic application. Any subsequently discovered errors or changes in exposures must be brought to our attention a.s.a.p.</p>
	<br>
	<h3 class="legalHeader">Language</h3>
	<p>The Language flag in the application applies to the final Policy Documents. Not to the interface language.</p>
